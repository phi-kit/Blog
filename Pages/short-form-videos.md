# Short Form Videos

While TikTok is very popular in the short form video content. I'm going to switch to YouTube Shorts. It helps that I have a subscription to YouTube so I don't get sponsored ads. That's the problem I have with TikTok, too many ads. This is the same with Facebook. Instagram has a similar short feature as well, but they have an interesting quirk that I don't like about it; when you click on it, it doesn't pause the video, it just mutes it.
