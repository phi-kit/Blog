# Future

General quick list of some things I want to add in the near future.

- I want to convert the website to C#
- I want to integrate with a database to load and manipulate content on the page
- I want to integrate with the Cloudinary API for some quick image utilities. 
- I want to integrate with the Gemini API to convert my Gemini Gems into an application that me and anyone interested to use as well.
