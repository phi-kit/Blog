# Copyright Legality

Conversations and articles surrounding AI use and copyright infringement has gotten me curious about what the copyright rules are. My understanding is that AI generated works is under public domain, as a default because one can only copyright work done by humans and the legality of ownership with AI generated works is still being defined. For anyone using AI, the best legal defense is to put as much personal touch possible before submitting it as our own, but it is hard to define when the manipulation of AI generated content is enough to be considered a personal work. Some say one can see and read AI responses, but the work has to start from the grown up from scratch. That's noble, but won't always be the case for everyone. 

Aside from the complexity of unknown of AI copyright legality, there is still the copyright laws that we already have. You can formally register copyrights, but copyrights are automatic--one doesn't have to define a license for their work. What I read often in my conversation with Gemini is that copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. People argue fair use when they use a piece of someone's work as their own, but the size allowed is poorly defined and ultimately falls under the license holder or the court if the person making a derivative work wants to argue with the copyright holder. 

The more I read about copyright, the more I see copyright infringement. People think it's okay to do something not knowing that it is not, or is knowingly doing so and is just trying to make money off of someone else's work. I see the value in copyright. Something that you take hours to build and perfect deserves to be recognized and projected. A plagiarist in the eyes of the copyright holder is right to feel cheated on. 

However, there is a right way to use copyright and that usually falls under public domain and licensing. A person is free to declare their work as public domain immediately if they choose, or have it expire after their death. Either way that means you are free to use and re-invent. I recently realize that's why we have so many variations of biblical stories, stories of Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland: They are in public domain. Just keep in mind that the variation gets protected too. Then there is licensing and it is how we have movies that references popular songs, a movie like Ready Player One which has popular intellectual property (IP) every couple of seconds, a game like Kingdom Hearts that that cross Final Fantasy and Disney, a clothing store called Hot Topic that sells t-shirts and merchandise based on IP, and a line of toys called Funko Pop that has similar likenesses to an IP. Companies spend a lot of money for rights to sell derivative work. For a person to shortcut and not acquire necessary licensing before selling a derivative work is unfair to those who do. 

That's an introduction to what I really want to research for this article and that's the question of, "What's in the public domain?", "What are examples of works based on public domain?", "What are some good examples of legal licensing", and "What are the gray areas?"

## Gray Area

If you're not making money off of your derivative work, you're likely not going to get into trouble. Though, if the copyright holder wants to protect their work, they can ask you to remove it. The reality is that, if you're not making much money from it ~and~ your work is not causing the copyright holder to lose money, you might be fine. In a lot of copyright infringement, the copyright holder can see it as free advertisement. In a platform like YouTube, copyright holders can request videos be taken down, and in the case of monetized videos, they can actually claim the revenue on the video instead.
