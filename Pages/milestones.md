# Milestones

Summary of the evolution of the website. 

- 20251019: Update the blog's page styles. Learned how to finetune the website with Tailwind classes. Started a link section. Set up an email forwarding system with the domain.
- 20251014: Cloudflare domain registration.
- 20251011: Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 built with Raspberry Pi OS installed on it: Major obstacle was realizing that if the Compute Module has eMMC memory, I can't use the microSD card slot as the boot operating system. I had to use my laptop with a cord into IO board and load the operating system directly into the Compute Module.
- 20251010: Raspberry Pi delivered.
