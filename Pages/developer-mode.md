# Developer Mode

Turning on developer mode for your phone allows you to get more control over device and do things that you normally would. Below are general instructions, but you might need to do a search to find the exact location for your version and device. 

- Settings: Find the settings section. You can normally do this by clicking on the gear icon when you're swiping from the top of your screen down. 
- About Phone: There's a section when you'll find out more information on your phone like your model name and the Android version. 
- Build Number: You'll want to look for the configuration for the "build number". Once you find it, you need to click on it 7 times to enable developer mode
